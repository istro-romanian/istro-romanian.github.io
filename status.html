The IstroRomanian community is not recognized in the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia as one of the country's official national minorities. The Constitution does stipulate in its "Historical Foundation" section the existence of Romanians, Vlachs and <i>others</i> as members of its national minorities. <br>
<p>
The community enjoys, however, a degree of recognition at the local level and is specifically identified and named in the regional charter of Istria County and in the official statutes of the various communities their villages belong to.<br>
<p>
The IstroRomanian community is also the subject of several laws passed by the Romanian Parliament, including the Constitution of the country. These laws address broadly the situation of what the Romanian state defines as “Romanians Abroad” - an all encompassing term which includes both Romanians and “linguistic minorities” that live in neighboring countries, as well as the more recent Romanian diaspora from throughout the globe.
<p>
Lastly, the IstroRomanian community has been the subject of a number of international treaties and documents including a specific motion on its situation submitted to the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly.<br>

<b>Difficult cultural situation of the Istro-Romanian minority particularly threatened </b><br>
</center>
<p>
Motion for a resolution presented by Mr Vlad Cubreacov and others<br>
<p>
Having ascertained that the Istro-Romanian minority inhabits eight villages (Having ascertained that the Istro-Romanian minority inhabits eight villages (Žejane/Jeiăni, Brdo/Bârda, Jesenovik/Sucodru, Nova Vas/Nosela, Kostracani/Costârceani, Šušnjevica/Șușneviță/Susgnevizza, Letaj and Zankovci) in the Peninsula of Istria (Croatia), on the Northern part of the Adriatic Sea, in the historical region of Ciceria and that this minority is not officially recognised by Croatia;<br>
<p>
Also having ascertained that after the World War II an Istro-Romanian diaspora was established in Italy, Trieste region, and that small communities of Istro-Romanian origin inhabit Golac and Polijane localities in Slovenia, on the Northern part of the historical region of Ciceria;<br>
<p>
Recalling the inland nature of the Istro-Romanian minority on the territory it inhabits historically for centuries;<br>
<p>
Noting that the Istro-Romanian, quoted in the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages as "seriously endangered", is an historical Romanian dialect spoken by a population of between 500 and 1 500 persons that call themselves by endonyme Rumâni/Rumâri/Rumeri (Romanians) and being called by exonym Ćiribiri or Ćići by Croats, Slovenians and Italians, and Istro-Romanians by linguists;<br>
<p>
Taking into account that between 1921 and 1925 the Traian Emperor School operated in Šušnjevica/Șușnevița village where the school subjects have been taught in the Istro-Romanian dialect and in literary Romanian language, and this school was established by Mr. Andrei Glavina, an Istro-Romanian professor;<br>
<p>
Taking note of the fact that during the last years the Istro-Romanian Association "Andrei Glavina" has published in Trieste (Italy), by its own means, a journal called <i>Scrisore către fraț rumeri</i> (Letter for Romanian brothers);<br>
<p>
Noting with satisfaction that it was possible to organise the first Istro-Romanian Congress at Pula University in spring 2000;<br>
<p>
Regretting that the Istro-Romanians, as an officially unrecognised minority, do not benefit of any public education, any religious assistance and do not have any written press or broadcast media in their own language;<br>
<p>
Being concerned for the continuous decrease of the number of Istro-Romanians due to their assimilation by neighbouring nationalities, as regards a minority seriously threatened by disappearance;<br>
<p>
Assessing that this worrisome and even critical situation does not comply with the Council of Europe norms and standards;<br>
<p>
Taking into account the commitments taken by the Council of Europe member states towards the minorities, as well as the rights and commitments of the kin-states towards their minorities abroad,<br>
<p>
The Assembly,<br>
<p>
Invites Croatian authorities to recognise officially the Istro-Romanian minority and to ensure the respect for its fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights and namely the linguistic, cultural and religious rights, especially in the following fields:<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>education in its mother tongue;
<li>worship services in its mother tongue;
<li>newspapers, journals, radio and TV broadcasts in its mother tongue; 
<li>and support for Istro-Romanian cultural associations;
</ol>
Invites the authorities of Romania, as a kin-state, to co-operate with Croatian authorities in order to take urgently all necessary measures to preserve the identity of the Istro-Romanian minority, especially threatened and to support the least spoken Istro-Romanian dialect;<br>
<p>
Invites Croatian authorities to consider the possibility for implementing, through the most appropriate means, the following measures:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>gradual implementation of the mother tongue in the children education (to use verbally the Istro-Romanian dialect in the preschool education and the normalized Romanian forms of the mother tongue in the primary education);
<li>respect and public aid for the local use of the Istro-Romanian dialect and the normalized Romanian language, and their current use in the second level education and by media in the concerned localities, in the extent the communities that speak them need;
<li>permit to hold worship services in the Istro-Romanian dialect and in the normalized Romanian language in churches situated in the Istro-Romanian villages, in order to give the Istro-Romanians the possibility to sing canticles in their mother tongue;
<li>organisation of international discussion forums and expert seminars to study and identify properly the features of the Istro-Romanian dialect and culture; 
</ul>
Empowers its competent committee to put on the agenda of its forthcoming meetings the issue of the endangered Istro-Romanian minority, to watch closely the development of its situation and to submit a Report concerning this issue.<br>

<b>4. Implementation of the charter: analysis of replies received to the questionnaire</b><br>       
4.5. The situation of the Istro-Romanian minority in Croatia: example of the need for protection of languages<br>
</center>
<p>
53. In its reply to the questionnaire concerning the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Croatia did not mention the Istro-Romanian minority. It does not regard the Istro-Romanian language as falling within the scope of application of the charter. The Istro-Romanian minority group, which is said to consist of 500 to 1 500 members inhabiting eight villages in Istria (Croatia), has not been officially recognised by Croatia.<br> 
<p>
54. On 12 October 2006, Croatia presented its third periodical report on the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. In its evaluation report, the committee of experts expressed that it would welcome information about the Istro-Romanian language in the next periodical report. In reply to this request, the Croatian authorities, in their comments on the third periodical report, declared the following: "As regards the Istro-Romanian language we have the pleasure to inform you that in September 2007 the Ministry of Culture rendered a decision by which the Istro-Romanian language was given the status of non-material cultural wealth, and as such is registered in the Register of Cultural Wealth of the Republic of Croatia – the list of Protected Cultural Wealth. In this way, too, care has been demonstrated by which Croatia approaches the protection of all cultural diversities, including the protection of minority languages."<br>
<p>
55. The protection of the Istro-Romanian language, which is apparently threatened with extinction, therefore requires further attention. Official recognition of the Istro-Romanian minority by Croatia and its protection under the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages are necessary in order to ensure the full protection of this language. I hope that the forthcoming report of the committee of experts will take this into consideration.<br>
